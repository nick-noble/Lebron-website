<h1>About Lebron</h1>
<p>
    Lebron James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio. He was drafted in 2003 as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was one of the only people in NBA history to be drafted straight out of high school. Lebron has won 4 NBA championships over the course of his career, and has won a ring with 3 different teams. He has also won 4 NBA MVP awards as well, and it is heavily argued that he should have won more.He currently is the all time leading scorer, which is a record that most people thought to be unbreakable. He is a 19 time all star, and has made the finals 10 times in his career. Some people bash Lebron for making the finals 10 times, and only winning 4 times, however I think that making the finals should be looked at as more of an accomplishment than not making the finals all together. Making the finals means that you were the best team in that conference that you play in, and if you look at the teams that he was on for the tail end of his Cleveland career, you would see why he wasn't able to beat some of the teams that he was playing in the finals. He was going against the biggest star power in NBA history.
