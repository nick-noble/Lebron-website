    Nick's Favorite Celebrity
</h1>
<p>
    This website is dedicated to my favorite celebrity Lebron James. Lebron James is the player that got me into basketball. He has been the face of the league for almost 2 decades, and is one of, if not THE greatest basketball player of all time. He has been playing at a high level for 20 years, and counting.
