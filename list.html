<h2>Lebron's top 5 moments in the NBA</h2>
<ol>
    <li>2016 NBA Finals Game 7 Chasedown Block on Andre Iguodala</li>
    <li>2009 NBA First MVP</li>
    <li>2013 NBA Finals Game 7 vs San Antonio Spurs</li>
    <li>2007 Eastern Conference Finals Game 5 vs Detroit Pistons</li>
    <li>2018 Playoff Run</li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are my personal picks for Lebron's top 5 moments in the NBA. The chasedown block is one of the most iconic moments of his career. This solidified the Cavaliers championship, coming back from a 3-1 deficit, after returning to the teamt that originally drafter him. <br>The next best moment was the first MVP award that he won. This is when we really knew that he was the face of the league.<br> 2013 game 7 against the spurs is when Lebrons entire legacy was on the line, and he NEEDED to perform. He showed out, and had an incredible game, and led the heat to another championship.<br> The 2007 playoff run in general was a sight to behold. He was only 22 years old, leading a team that had really no other good player outside of Lebron to the finals that year.<br> Finally the 2018 playoff run. This is where he led a team by himself, while averaging 34 points, 9 rebound, and 9 assists. He had the entire team on his back, and almost was able to get it done. We might never see a performance like that ever again.
